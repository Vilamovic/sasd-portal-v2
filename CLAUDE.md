## ⚠️ Quick Start for AI

1. **Read [PROJECT.md](./PROJECT.md) completely**

4. **Create TodoWrite checklist** if task is non-trivial
5. **Follow patterns** from PROJECT.md

## 🔑 Critical Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

### 1. WAIT FOR TASK
❌ **DO NOT generate code** until you receive a specific task from the user.

### 2. PLANNING FIRST
✅ Use **TodoWrite** tool to create and track task checklist.

### 3. PRESERVE BUSINESS LOGIC
❌ **NEVER change** business logic (useEffect, handlers, async operations).
✅ **ONLY change** UI (colors, layout, classes, icons).

### 4. NO NEW FILES
❌ **DO NOT create** new files without explicit permission.

### 5. AUTONOMOUS DETECTIVE
✅ Use Glob, Grep, Read to explore codebase.
❌ **DO NOT ask** for locations of existing logic.
